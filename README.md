# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜ƒ

Welcome to Yiwei's Coding Playground! 

### <ðŸ™ˆ> About me </ðŸ™ˆ>

My name is Yiwei, I'm a second-year graduate student at Columbia Engineering. I'm a foodie, vlogger, certified optimist, professional kindergarten-level painter, Michelin "star" chef specializing in cleaning up messes after cooking, and a long-distance runner who is best at the first 400 metersðŸ’ª

Just kidding...Actually, I'm a data enthusiast, dedicated to pursuing my love and passion for data engineering, and I see myself as a serious and aspiring future **data engineer**. 

#### Currently I'm proactively exploring wider paths and various toolkits in data eng, so I'm here on GitHub to:
- Share my learning resources and growth story as a newbie in the industry;
- Gain more hands-on experiences through side projects to better understand data eng.;
- Learn more about data-eng/DevOps/backend toolkits;
- Get inspiration for new ideas!

Feel free to visit [my repositories](https://github.com/hywvivi98?tab=repositories). Please don't hesitate to open an **issue** or a **pull request** if you see there's a better approach or have any feedback and suggestions! I would really appreciate it!
